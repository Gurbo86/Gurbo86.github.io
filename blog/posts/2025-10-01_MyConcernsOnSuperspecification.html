        <p>
            In the last few years, I have noticed that the super-specification of design areas is growing increasingly, to some extent (at least from my perspective), unnecessarily. This super-specification at the beginning used to be centralized on areas that would require going the extra mile, for example, technical design (which requires some basic knowledge of code) or economy design (which involves an understanding of monetization and game economy balancing). However, I feel that over the last few years, we have been overspecifying simple tasks that were once part of the generic game design process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recently, I have seen job searches for specialists on 3Cs, Vehicles, Weapons, or FTUE. All these searches were not for consultancy or short-term contracts, but for full-time permanent positions. The thing that confuses me the most is that all these positions tend to immediately exclude someone who may have worked on these areas in the past, just because you are not working on these areas nowadays, which is weird if not a total misconception.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the case of programming, super-specifications sometimes make sense, even though they have increased ridiculously with the flavor tech trend of the time over the last 10 years. However, in the case of game design, extreme super-specification is unnecessary and can create excessive codependency in a project, as well as several unrealistic expectations for the job position.
        </p>
        <p>
            The problem with the approach is generally that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The work in a specific area is generally limited, and once it is done, tons of work await in the pile of things that have nothing to do with the particular area.
            </li>
            <li>
                Most of the specialists in certain areas nowadays are just people that has been able to be in the right place at the right time, which might not certify anything about what they are specialized in.
            </li>
            <li>
                Hiring someone because they can cover only one area in the whole development process, which will probably take a small period of time in that process, is not so effective.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Making the super-specification of an area so small, 3Cs or Social, is sincerely not scalable unless we are talking of an AAA game. Even in those cases, we can realize that the approach in the last 4 years has done more damage than favours to the industry, considering the releases that we recently have didn&rsquo;t meet the expectations or simply were dead on arrival.
        </p>
        <p>
            The hiring process in recent years has also deteriorated due to these overly specific role expectations that are difficult to match. We can see companies with fewer than 50 employees looking for these particular roles, which is an unnecessary overkill.  This, and the incorporation of different candidate filter programs, which can barely understand the nuances of the area we are talking about, has contributed to the hellscape that is the job market in the game industry nowadays. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This kind of approach, from my perspective, should be reversed to the 2010s approach of specification, which consisted mainly of Technical, Economy, and Level, as these are areas that require a whole secondary set of skills or full-time dedication. Perhaps I would incorporate Systems, but I think this can be a secondary post, as nowadays it is hard for many people to define the difference between this and technical, as it is also hard to explain the difference between technical and gameplay programmer.
        </p>
        <p>
            This trend (because this is no more than that) is hurting everyone, and it is only making the search for resources worse. I think that there&rsquo;s not one place to blame but lots of things that contribute to this situation to keep growing:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The companies that are falling in line with trends and asking the recruiters for such specificity.
            </li>
            <li>
                The recruiters who are not warning the companies about the nuances of these requests.
            </li>
            <li>
                The specialists who self-promote these trends, when they probably know that it is not a thing (or not, maybe they think this is a thing).
            </li>
            <li>
                The people who sell this trend as a thing to give courses that are not that worthy, to be honest.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            From my perspective, a specialist should be hired mainly as a contractor or consultant to cover an area that once worked on will not change or won&rsquo;t vary significantly. Only in rare cases, someone might need to hire someone only for the speciality of their most recent work. Experience in design doesn&rsquo;t go away with time, and new trends can be easily learned with background knowledge. But the most important aspect when hiring designers is the core of solid game designer skills, and I think it is a mistake to be looking primarily for super-specified skills that should be nice to have.
        </p>
        <p>
            And with this, I&rsquo;m not saying you should not hire a specialist, but the benefits will be mainly seen in:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Games with long life expectancy and needing specific specialists.
            </li>
            <li>
                Companies that have multiple game projects in development need the skills to be used numerous times.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maybe AAA games that the earnings expectancy justify covering the costs of being too selective.
            </li>
            <li>
                A company that dedicates itself only to one genre and the market share justifies it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For all the rest of the cases, most of the time is enough to have a good experience designer who embraces any design task with the same passion that the skill requires. Game designers are specialists in enhancing the player experience to the maximum possible, ensuring that the product to be released, maintained, and updated is as compelling as possible for players. Any designer should be able to find an approach and innovate on it sufficiently to achieve their goal.
