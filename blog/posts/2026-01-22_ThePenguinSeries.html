        <p>
            For a long time, I&rsquo;d been thinking about what to write, but today I realised that this is my blog and 
            I&rsquo;m going to write about whatever I feel like. This is a personal take on The Penguin, and it will 
            contain spoilers, so if you haven&rsquo;t seen it, you might not want to read it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I&rsquo;ve just watched the final episode of “The Penguin” and I have to say this miniseries (because, in 
            my opinion, it should stay that way) makes the finished product excellent. From the character creation 
            (villains, in this case), to the script, to the performances, especially those of Colin Farrell, 
            Cristin Milioti, Deirdre O&rsquo;Connell, and Rhenzy Feliz.
        </p>
        <p>The Penguin starts with a comfortable Oswald Cobblepot in a Gotham City on fire (or, rather, underwater
            ). With a position in the mafia as a boss, running what seems to be his own operation, and waiting for 
            an opportunity to take his next step up. Everything is running like a British train (on time and as it 
            should) when something inside him pushes him into making a string of mistakes that will set all the 
            events of the series in motion, but let&rsquo;s not get ahead of ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>In the opening minutes of the series, Oswald, in the middle of the night, walks into the Iceberg Lounge 
            and breaks into the safe that belongs to Carmine Falcone, getting diamonds and blackmail material that 
            will allow him to move forward in his search for power. But Alberto Falcone, none other than the son 
            of the capo who died in The Batman, catches him red-handed. Faced with the complicated situation he&rsquo;s 
            in, he tries to navigate it with real expertise, trading money for power, handing the diamonds over to 
            Alberto, until Alberto hits a raw nerve in his ego, and Oswald, seeing himself in that insult, 
            proceeds to put three shots into his chest.
        </p>
        <p>
            From that unfortunate event, Oswald goes on to do what he&rsquo;s done his whole life: sweep the dirt under 
            the rug and lie. But this time, by some twist of fate, he meets Víctor Aguilar, someone he gradually 
            learns to see as a friend and ally on the path he has to walk through this miniseries.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately for Oswald, his slip-up is no small thing, because the man he killed is none other than 
            Sofia Falcone&rsquo;s brother, a brother who believed in her and helped keep her sane during her time in 
            Arkham Asylum. And it just so happens that Sofía has been recently released from the Asylum, so he has 
            to erase the clues that would point to him as guilty of the crime.
        </p>
        <p>
            That is simply the beginning of The Penguin: a simple, classic pitch, like any crime programme (not a 
            superhero one) you might find in American primetime. What comes after this brief description is what 
            makes it unique.
        </p>
        <p>
            The series goes down a classic route in terms of its format, becoming raw; not because of the crime, 
            nor because of the gangster life, nor because of the illusory idea that you have to give everything to 
            win the crown, but rather by showing what it seems we all know and none of us dares to say. The top is 
            full of broken people; the crown comes with its weight, and owning it is only an illusion we should 
            question, whether it&rsquo;s really worth it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The series gives each character space to explain why they are the way they are, and what makes it so 
            good is that, at no point, is it presented as a justification of their crimes, but rather as a way of 
            giving us a sense of the motivations behind each character. We don&rsquo;t have a Harleen Quinzel who 
            justifies her wrongdoing because she was abused by the Joker; instead, for each character essential to 
            the plot, we get almost an episode explaining where they came from, where we&rsquo;re standing now, and 
            where we&rsquo;re going.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of this is woven into the present-day events of the series so well that even the aesthetic choices 
            feel extremely appropriate, and the high point of those decisions is the final episode. Some of these 
            big choices come through in the decision to keep Oswald&rsquo;s mother in her elderly form as the image that 
            lives in his memory, as if she herself were re-evaluating her memories while living them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The series can pass for a straightforward mob show. If we didn&rsquo;t know about Batman, it could be a 
            parallel thread in a season of The Sopranos (with more explosions and bigger traumas), but, at the end 
            of the day, it&rsquo;s just back-and-forth manoeuvring in which the underdog climbs his ladder towards mob 
            glory. That is, until episode 8, where everything is resolved in a masterful way.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the final episode, you find a lot of answers to many questions, both fictional and real.
        </p>
        <h1>
            In this film, the good ones die
        </h1>
        <p>
            As Attaque 77 said back in 2003: “No happy ending, in this film, the good ones die.” The Penguin isn&rsquo;t 
            a story with a happy ending, but it&rsquo;s a perfect example of how you take a comic-book villain out of 
            his stiff world of fiction and bring him into a story that&rsquo;s closer to the “real world”. In this story, 
            we&rsquo;re shown an ambitious Oswald, with attitudes closer to noir crime fiction, only to turn him back 
            into the cruel, unhinged villain he is in the comics in the final minute of the miniseries.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because The Penguin only tells the origin story, in which fans will feel that several basic aspects of 
            the villain are covered. The umbrella, given that his Cain-and-Abel crime happens on a night of heavy 
            rain in Gotham. The suit, given his fascination with Top Hat, a film he will watch for the nth time 
            that same night. And abandonment, replaced by a sickly relationship with his mother, which gets an 
            excellent twist in the final episode of the series.
        </p>
        <p>
            The character of Sofia Falcone, the antagonist of this series (and not a villain, because everyone is 
            bad here), is one of the few you can empathise with, up to a point, in terms of what she does. A 
            victim of a tyrannical father, locked up for ten years in Arkham, she returns to the world to find 
            that her only anchor, her brother, has been killed by the person who ratted her out out of curiosity 
            and, in part, sent her to that cruel prison. Only through her choice, the path of revenge, does she 
            end up becoming just another one in the flock of sinners.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only Víctor Aguilar, whom Oswald will gradually drag down the path of sin through innocence, is the 
            character any decent person can find something to empathise with, and who, sadly, will pay the price 
            for his innocence and good faith at the hands of his new fraternal figure.
        </p>
        <h1>
            The Godfather&rsquo;s rise
        </h1>
        <p>
            In episode 6 of The Penguin, we see Cobblepot manage to unite the other gangs (the Triads, the 
            Sullivan Crime Family, Burnley Town Massive, the Odessa Mob, and The Low Boys) into a united front 
            against the Maroni/Gigante alliance.
        </p>
        <p>
            It&rsquo;s important to highlight that the gangs&rsquo; unity is consolidated mainly not by the leaders, but by 
            those beneath them: their seconds-in-command. And the reason for that lies in the speech — who gives 
            it and what it represents. Cobblepot&rsquo;s speech is about how the most powerful family, the one that runs 
            the rest of the gangs, has lost touch with the reality of the other crews. While Maroni/Gigante are 
            comfortable and enjoy the riches of the business, the rest of the smaller gangs do the work that keeps 
            them in those comforts.
        </p>
        <p>
            And what reaches the seconds-in-command is how Cobblepot presents himself as one of them — those at the 
            bottom — with the idea of taking them upwards; something he will end up doing for himself by the end of 
            the series. The problem here is for the capos, who are in a position where they don&rsquo;t quite understand 
            (or don&rsquo;t want to) the concerns of those below, and how that will end up working against them.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can see this in the response from the Triads&rsquo; leader, Zao, who appeals to common sense, pointing to 
            Oswald as a code-less liar — which he is — but he offers no solution to the situation Oz describes. For 
            Zao, Oz is a danger, and Maroni/Gigante, even if he doesn&rsquo;t like them, allows him to stay in his 
            comfortable position. The contrast is his second-in-command, who connects with the speech, even though 
            he knows Cobblepot is lying, because he lives what happens on the streets.
        </p>
        <p>
            And at the end of this episode, Cobblepot does exactly that: he explains what the ordinary mobster 
            feels when he has to sell the drug on a street corner — “drops” in the series — that make millions for 
            Maroni/Gigante for a miserable margin, and earn their contempt, while they swim in the opulence of 
            their neighbourhoods and mansions.
        </p>
        <p>
            He explains how, from their ivory tower, Maroni/Gigante don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening beneath them, to 
            the point that they don&rsquo;t even know the names of the people they run, because they have someone in the 
            middle who knows them on their behalf. And that middle layer, the heads of the five families, probably 
            don&rsquo;t know either, because for that they have a second-in-command who will take care of knowing it and 
            doing the organisation&rsquo;s dirty work.
        </p>
        <p>
            And that&rsquo;s why, at the start of episode 8, even though the pact from episode 6 is accepted by everyone, 
            the heads of the five families are eliminated, because they belong to the old order, and the new order 
            sees reality the way Cobblepot does.
        </p>
        <h1>
            A Miniseries
        </h1>
        <p>
            The Penguin is an eight-episode series, but, in my view, it should remain a miniseries. Víctor&rsquo;s death 
            at the end marks the high point of what the Penguin is, because it perfectly captures that villain who 
            doesn&rsquo;t hesitate for a second to eliminate anyone who becomes a vulnerability; although in this case, 
            he doesn&rsquo;t do it because Víctor is dead weight.
        </p>
        <p>
            Víctor dies because he&rsquo;s the closest person Cobblepot has after his own mother&rsquo;s betrayal, and he 
            can&rsquo;t allow anyone to be close, because anyone close is likely to be a traitor or a weapon that can be 
            used against him.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this way, the miniseries would close an essential arc that would allow the character's future 
            appearances, but any continuation would dull its shine. The series shouldn&rsquo;t have a continuation; it 
            should make way for other origin miniseries or development arcs scattered within it.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the final cliffhangers, we have Selina Kyle (Catwoman), who appears at the end of the series as 
            Sofia Falcone/Gigante&rsquo;s half-sister (something that was already known from The Batman), as well as how 
            Julian Rush, Sofia&rsquo;s psychologist, will evolve, and what Sofia herself will become now that she 
            understands what she wants to do with her life and will have plenty of time to think about how to do 
            it in Arkham.
